# Embedded C Programming Examples

This repository contains code I developed while practicing embedded programming and some code from following multiple courses by **FastBit Embedded Brain Academy** on Udemy.

The examples include low-level peripheral programming for STM32 microcontrollers, covering GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, and more using register-level access in C.
