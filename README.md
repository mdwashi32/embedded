# Embedded C Programming Examples

This repository contains code I developed while practicing embedded programming and some code from following multiple courses by **FastBit Embedded Brain Academy** on Udemy.

The examples include low-level peripheral programming for STM32 microcontrollers, covering GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, and more using register-level access in C.

## üß™ Projects

Various embedded systems projects built using STM32 and possibly other microcontrollers. More projects will be added over time.

### üî∑ STM32 Real-Time Clock with LCD Display

Project that uses the DS1307 RTC to display time and date on a character LCD using I2C and GPIO drivers.
